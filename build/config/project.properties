# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  =


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages        =


# site manifest
# this is the name of the manifest file you declared in the <html> tag
file.manifest    = site.manifest

# the files listed after will be replaced in the manifest by the concatened and minified file
# add only the files that are listed in the development manifest (and exactly as listed)
# Example :
# manifest.files.javascripts = /js/plugin.js, /js/script.js, /js/mylibs/hightcharts.min.js, /js/mylibs/jquery.isotope.min.js
# in the manifest all this files will be replaced by a259704144778afa7178a074e6f358d283471355.js which is the concatened and minified javascript file

# Files can be added in a comma separated form
manifest.files.javascripts = /js/plugin.js, /js/script.js
manifest.files.stylesheets = 

# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
file.exclude      =


# Specify an environment to build
#
# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if buidling a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment
env               =


# Directory Structure
#
# Override any directory paths specific to this project
#
# dir.publish
# dir.js
# dir.js.libs
# dir.js.mylibs
# dir.css
# dir.images
